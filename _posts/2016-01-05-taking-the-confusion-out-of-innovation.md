# Taking the confusion out of innovation

If you are a founder of a startup, you have to take a thousand decisions or more. You have to decide who to team up with, what your product will be, how you will produce and deliver it, what people to target and how to get them to become customers. What channels to use, what promotion, what pricing, what features to offer. What technology to use, and which providers. And somehow you need to figure out how to fund your startup through its development phases.

It is a daunting challenge to get all of these right. Help is offered along the way, in the shape of sympathetic advisors armed with templates, like the often used _business model canvas_. But advisors will often impose their own experience and ideas on the startup, which usually leads to widely differing if not contradictory suggestions. And those canvases are nice for founders who have already figured out what their plans are, but not particularly helpful when you do not know where to begin.

A much improved method has been receiving increasing attention over the last years. It is called _lean startup_ and it tells startup founders to figure out what the weakest spot is in their whole business idea, and find a way to test that one first. Usually it is about customers really needing the solution sufficiently to make them want to pay for it.
